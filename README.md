 ## Timeline
 * **12/3 - 20/3:** 
Started working on the Project and did some research on App Generators, [here is a summary](AppBuilders.md).\
**Hours worked: 4h**
 * **25/3 - 26/3:** 
Started implementing the app generator, a script that receives a json file that has description of each component we want to add, and then generated an angular components with those components, for now we only can read the json app and generate the angular app,next step is to create pre define components like buttons and add them based on the json file rules.\
**Hours worked: 2h**
 * **27/3:** 
Successfully added the first element dynamically based on the json File. Added all the needed pre-built components to the base project, and then we clone it and add to the main html page the components that are in the components array in the json file.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
* **28/3:** 
Successfully positioned elements based on the json values and not just using a pre-defined values.Modified the json file format. And started working on the design, only thing missing is adding the class name to the relevant component.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
* **1/4:** 
Added the styles to the relevant elements, added 2 more built-in components, and started working on the logic, if clicked on button then we change the chosen component style, changed the JSON file.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
