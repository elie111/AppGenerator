before I start work on 19.3 I must finish my current task and respond to Roi


- FlutterFlow:
 works via drag and drop, getting more attention lately, use flutter which is open source, connect to Firebase and GitHub
for certain functionality, must write code
build a very simple app but checked it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Glide:
 works via description and AI, simple apps, predefined template, use Excel and google sheets as data bases.
you can create screens and define the navigation and the purpose of each screen and can you many options far data sources
build a very simple app but checked it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AppSmith:
 didn't build an app nor check it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Bravo:
can design an app on Figma and then connect it to Bravo and it will be generated.
didn't build an app, checked it out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draftbit:
gives the option to start with a blank project or a predefined template
and can connect to many backend options and supports many deployment options
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adalo:
similar to the other tools, we have the option of picking a predefined template or start from scratch, we can build the app via choosing built in components and choosing styles, and connecting a database of our choosing, for all platforms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble:
We can pick built in components to build our app like headers and menus or we can create shapes and define their layout and we can add conditional styles, something that we can do more easily compared to other tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunkable:
my second favorite after FlutterFlow, very easily create logic by connecting the flow like puzzle pieces, for all platforms and easily build or connect your database
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jotform:
much simpler and less capable than the other tools I checked, but also much easier to use, as the other tools we can choose a predefined template or we can  start from a blank app
