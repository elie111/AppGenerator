 ## Timeline
 * **12/3 - 20/3:** 
Started working on the Project and did some research on App Generators, [here is a summary](AppBuilders.md).\
**Hours worked: 4h**
 * **25/3 - 26/3:** 
Started implementing the app generator, a script that receives a json file that has description of each component we want to add, and then generated an angular components with those components, for now we only can read the json app and generate the angular app,next step is to create pre define components like buttons and add them based on the json file rules.\
**Hours worked: 2h**
 * **27/3:** 
Successfully added the first element dynamically based on the json File. Added all the needed pre-built components to the base project, and then we clone it and add to the main html page the components that are in the components array in the json file.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
* **28/3:** 
Successfully positioned elements based on the json values and not just using a pre-defined values.Modified the json file format. And started working on the design, only thing missing is adding the class name to the relevant component.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
* **1/4:** 
Added the styles to the relevant elements, added 2 more built-in components, and started working on the logic, if clicked on button then we change the chosen component style, changed the JSON file.\
**Hours worked: 3h**
* **2/4:** 
Started working on routing to move between screens.\
**Hours worked: 1h**
* **3/4:** 
Fixed few styling issues, and Created first version of the app with basic elements positioning and styling for my Demo inside the vesrion_1 branch, and worked on trying to solve the routing problem.\
**Hours worked: 2h**
* **4/4 - 7.4:** 
Had a meeting with my Supervisor Roi and discussed my progress and points to Improve. Also started doing research on other frontend frameworks that I can use insteaad of Angular to learn something new, my 2 candidates are Flutter and React.\
**Hours worked: 2h**
* **8.4 - 14.4:**
Decided I will switch to React since it is more suitable to my project since we can easily create mini components and position elements via css, even though it's also possible in flutter it's going to be much more challenging and take more time to do basic things. 
Bought a new [React Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25595350?start=0#overview) and watched the first 6 section that cover the basics of react such as how to create reusable components, and how to style them and more, I also watched the summary section at the end of the course to be learn a little bit about the more complex parts of React to see if they might help without deep diving into them.\
**Hours worked: 18h**
* **15.4:**
Started Migrating my project from Angular to React, and started working on creating basic components such as buttons and sections.\
**Hours worked: 4h**
* **16.4:**
Planned the way I need to implement the structute of the App. in react it's easy to pass objects to child components via prop, so I need to pass the styles as an object and the logic as functions.\
I started implementing that logic in the Base App and started migrating the script from Angular to React.\
**Hours worked: 4h**


**Total ammount of hours spent on the project: 46h**
