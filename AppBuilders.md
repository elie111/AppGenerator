## App Generators research summary:

* FlutterFlow
* Glide
* Adalo
* Thunkable
* Bubble
* Bravo
* Draftbit
* Jotform
* Wix 

**A very helpful guide I used: [wearenocode channel](https://www.youtube.com/@wearenocode)**

* General Summary:
> Almost all tools work the same way, choose a predefined template or start from zero and pick built in components to build you app, but they differ in their level of complexity, some are very limitted and some give us the option to write code manually, also not all tools are compatible with all platform (IOS, Android and Web).

* FlutterFlow:
>My favorite, Works via drag and drop, getting more attention lately, uses flutter which is open source, connect to Firebase and GitHub,
for complex logic and functionality we must add code manually. And it's compatible with all platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Glide:
>Works via text description and AI or via drag and drop, mainly for simple apps, uses predefined templates, uses Excel and google sheets as data bases.
you can create screens and define the navigation and the purpose of each screen and there are many options for data sources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Bravo:
>Can design an app on Figma and then connect it to Bravo and it will be generated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Draftbit:
>Gives the option to start with a blank project or a predefined template
and can connect to many backend options and supports many deployment options.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Adalo:
>Similar to the other tools, we have the option of picking a predefined template or start from scratch, we can build the app via choosing built in components and choosing styles, and connecting a database of our choosing, for all platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Bubble:
>We can pick built in components to build our app like headers and menus or we can create shapes and define their layout and we can add conditional styles, something that we can do more easily compared to other tools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Thunkable:
>My second favorite after FlutterFlow, create logic easily by connecting the app flow like puzzle pieces, compatible for all platforms and easily build new database or connect your existent database.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Jotform:
>Much simpler and less capable than the other tools, but also much easier to use, as the other tools we can choose a predefined template or we can  start from a blank app.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Wix:
>Follows same logic as most of the other App generatos, use predefined template or start from scratch, and use build in components to build your app and design it. An extra featue, scan the QR code so you can view the app on your mobile.
