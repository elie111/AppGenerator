<h1 align="center">TODO list </h1>
 
* Add routing logic, the main screen, has all the created screens and the routing logic
* each screen has all the elements that are added to it
* using descendant operator in css I can access the sub elements that I want to style in each screen
* using inheritance (@input and @output) I can pass the parameters that I want to the ts file to implement the logic for the same component that is being used multiple times
* I need to clearify what are the possible actions that can be done with each component (button: switch page, calculation, change style of another element, refresh)
* I need to think of how can I add a UI to create the JSON file instead of modifying it manually
